["culture.html", "Chapter 3 Lab culture and philosophy", " Chapter 3 Lab culture and philosophy We approach our science with a common denominator of kindness. As part of our core lab culture, we: Ask for help, and share our learning Make ourselves available Come prepared and engage Celebrate accomplishments (ours &amp; those of others) Sustain a positive, safe learning environment Have an interdisciplinary (open) mindset Are mindful of our own biases Plan with intention, and follow through Foster inclusivity within our group and greater community Promote and sustain healthy work-life integration Practice radical candor Acknowledge and give credit to other lab member’s work Though we do not expect incoming members to memorize everything, we do expect members to be aware of the group’s values. Ask for help, and share your learning: We are all learners, and most of our learning is done from each other. It is inefficient to struggle through problems alone. Ask for and give assistance with appropriate cognisense of the value of your time. You are not the first or last person to encounter a problem. When you identify a problem add an issue to the lab issues repository, and update it with solutions when it is resolved. Also consider writing a tutorial/blog post for inclusion in our lab’s shared resources, and share with the larger community by tweeting, leading and sharing at a lab meeting, or running a workshop (Quantfish woRkshop group, SouthCoast useR group, etc). Make yourself available: Be responsive to communication, and make time for things that address longer term goals, even when busy. For example, do not skip on things like attending seminars just because you have a big deadline looming (see note below on planning and organization). Note that being available does not mean that you are available 24/7 - this is not expected. Because as a group we value the role of collaboration and interaction in improving our work, it is expected that you be available in the lab/office during normal business hours for some time during the week (see section on attendance expectations). Come prepared and be engaged: Value your time. Be present during lab and individual meetings, and come to your work ready to do your work. Contribute and participate in planning and lab discussions. When it is your turn to run a meeting, come with an agenda and be prepared with questions. Try to view meetings as part of contributing to your work and productivity, rather than taking away from them. Celebrate accomplishments (yours &amp; others): You and your colleagues work hard. Things don’t always go exactly as you plan. Be supportive and proud of yourself and your peers when you accomplish things. We are not competing with each other - someone else’s success does not mean your failure. Share your accomplishments with others! Sustain a positive, safe learning environment: Everyone learns something for the first time at some time. Expressing that you don’t know something is OK, and we understand that this can make someone feel vulnerable. We strive to maintain a culture that allows for and encourages this vulnerability. Community members should not be disparaged for not knowing things, and in addition, should not be disparaged for knowing things or wanting to learn. Have an interdisciplinary (open) mindset: We apply our work at the science-policy interface. This means we work on problems that span multiple disciplines. Co-creation of knowledge requires transdisciplinary approaches that can result in solutions that would not be possible with siloing. You will be collaborating with others who have different types of expertise, values, and terminology. Trust the expertise of others and actively seek feedback recognizing the importance of specialization. Be mindful and aware of your own biases: We all have biases that are inherent and can not be removed, but we can still work on both being less biased, and more aware of bias in ourselves and others. Periodically check in on your biases. Plan with intention, and follow through: Be organized and adaptable. Things don’t always go as planned and that’s OK. Planning can help you adapt when they don’t (see Come Prepared). Find a program/project management approach that works for you (see “How we work”); being organized can reduce stress immensely and help you progress with your goals. Foster inclusivity within our group and greater community: Part of our lab culture is that we are good citizens of our community, we take on leadership roles within SMAST and the University, we are supportive of others in our community during their milestones, we actively participate in SMAST events (e.g. the IMS graduate research symposium) and perform outreach. Work with Gavin when crafting your individual mentoring/development plans (see Chapter on Onboarding) to identify what you want to aim your efforts at. Promote and sustain healthy work-life integration: Our scientific research is not the only important thing in our lives, and publishing research is not the only mechanism by which to provide science and support our communities. We recognize the importance of our other commitments in keeping us healthy (mentally and physically) and bring our whole selves to our efforts. Try not to normalize overwork or being busy as achievement or status. Practice radical candor: We care personally while also challenging directly. Be honest when communicating, accept critical (but kind) feedback, and give the same to others. View relationships within the group as collaborative rather than evaluative. Don’t take constructive criticism personally. Acknowledge and give credit: Working as part of a team, we will often (always?) be building on work done by others, receive assistance with work (see “Ask for help”), and using others’ words, code, content. Include acknowledgement and give credit for those contributions, in all forms of communication. We share content and code within the group with this expectation. One easy approach is to include hyperlinks to the work of others or their social media in your work. This also helps to amplify their voice and work as well as yours. "],
["code.html", "Chapter 4 Code of Conduct", " Chapter 4 Code of Conduct A Code of Conduct is a set of basic ground rules that we ask participants in lab spaces to follow. The goal is to create an open and inclusive space for our work that helps us achieve our collective goals. Along with our lab culture/philosophy, it also provides a benchmark for self-evaluation and helps better define our identity as a community. Our draft lab code of conduct can be found here. We are awaiting review by the SMAST Dean’s Office and the UMassD office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. We expect all lab members to adhere the policies and guidelines outlined here. Additional information and resources can be found in the SMAST Code of Conduct and Diversity Statement. Our Code of Conduct is based on the example policy created by the Geek Feminism community. "],

Navigate to Quicklaunch and click on HRDirect. You need to enter your UMassD user ID, password, and select the Dartmouth campus. If this is the first time you do this, you will also need to verify your account through DUO authorization. We recommend using the DUO app on your phone. You can choose to have push access, or send codes. After your initial setup, you can also opt to go through DUO 1/month (instead of every time you login to HRDirect). Even if you are salaried, it’s still important to keep track of and submit your vacation and sick time! 5.3 Key card building &amp; room access Mike Marino will have building &amp; room access forms for you to fill out and have approved and signed by Gavin. Typically, you will have access to the SMAST gate, SMAST East building, the lab space (room #245), classrooms, and if you are a grad student you will have access to the room where your desk will be. 5.4 Individual Development/Mentoring plans Within the first few weeks of joining the Fay Lab, you should work with Gavin to develop a plan outlining your short, medium, and long term goals. More on individual developing plans can be found in Chapter 6. "],
["expectations.html", "Chapter 6 Expectations 6.1 Working hours 6.2 Email 6.3 Attendance at regularly scheduled events 6.4 Outreach 6.5 Expectations for the PI 6.6 Graduate students 6.7 Undergraduate students 6.8 Postdoctoral researchers 6.9 Research staff", " Chapter 6 Expectations In addition to agreeing to follow our communities codes of conduct and the university academic integrity policy, we expect everyone in the group to echo our lab culture (Chapter 3). Individual mentoring plans: Gavin will work with each of you to develop your individual mentoring plan that serves to ensure your time in the Fay lab progresses your short, medium, and long-term goals. This is a useful planning document that assists in aligning expectations. Graduate students will revisit the mentoring plan during an individual meeting with Gavin at the beginning of each semester &amp; the start of summer. Other lab members will revisit these at appropriate time scales (e.g. every 6 months). A template for these, with thanks to @duffy_ma can be found here. In addition, it is useful to have broad (for all lab members) and specific (i.e., grad students, research staff, etc.) expectations of our roles clarified. These are outlined below. 6.1 Working hours Gavin generally does not hold people to working a fixed schedule, or to be in the office for a certain schedule. As adults, we should all set the working schedule that is the right fit for us, and it is likely that what this ‘fit’ is will change over the course of the time you are in the lab. Depending on the nature of your appointment, there may be specific hours that will need to be worked and you should work with your main collaborator to outline these. Gavin generally does not work evenings or on weekends, and does not expect that people in the lab are available at these times. Lab members should also not expect others to be available during these times. Graduate students are generally funded on annual research assistantship (RA) stipends. The RA contracts state that this stipend is for 20 hrs of work per week during the academic year and 40 hrs per week during summer to support full time study in the academic program. Most usually, students on RAships are being paid from a research grant where the focus of the grant is the topic the student is working on for their thesis research, so there is overlap here. We believe that training to do the research is part of the job, so this would include courses and additional time to read/learn methods, software too. Some people find that counting ‘billable hours’ is productive for them as it helps them keep accountable to themselves. Others do not find this method useful. Regularly assess what works best for you. Full time is enough, and we do not expect team members to work nights and weekends, though do not enforce a particular working hours schedule because students should feel flexible enough to create a work schedule that works for them. Lab members should not expect others to be available during evenings and weekends. There is value to interacting with others as part of your work, and we do expect you will be in the lab during normal working hours for at least some of the time during the week. We also recognize that there will occasionally be times where there is a need to work more to meet a deadline, but this should be the exception - an expectation of overwork is not to be normalized. 6.2 Email In the lab, we communicate via email. You should therefore check your email at least once a day during the normal work week. We also make use of Google Docs and issues on GitHub to record institutional knowledge and hold conversations regarding research tasks. Note that being available does not mean that you are available 24/7 - this is not expected. Do not expect responses to emails after regular business hours on weekdays, or on weekends. However, because we recognize that lab members should be able to create a working schedule that is right for them, lab members should not be penalized for sending communication during these times. 6.3 Attendance at regularly scheduled events Attendance is expected at: * Departmental seminars * Weekly lab meetings / quantfish woRkshops * Individual meetings with Gavin to discuss and work on your research * SMAST thesis and proposal defenses * SMAST all hands meetings / start-and-end of semester events * Annual UMass Intercampus Marine Science graduate research symposium 6.4 Outreach We share our learning and time with others beyond our lab, knowing that this builds community and ultimately improves both the quality and impact of our science. This doesn’t mean individuals do everything, however. We take on leadership roles within SMAST and the university, are supportive of others in our community during their milestones, actively participate in SMAST events (e.g. the IMS graduate research symposium), and perform outreach. Ask others in the lab about activities they are part of, and work with Gavin when crafting your mentoring plan to identify outreach strategy that meshes well with your goals. 6.5 Expectations for the PI Gavin (as PI) will (at a minimum) provide: * Technical support for analysis (e.g., access to computing, training on techniques) * Positive feedback &amp; constructive criticism on work * Professional career support * Support for non-technical aspects of making career progress * Regular meetings (every two weeks) to discuss work &amp; maintain progress on goals * Provide clear and honest appraisal of your funding situation 6.6 Graduate students You are responsible for your degree. This means you need to stay on top of program and university deadlines, requirements, etc. See Chapter 13 &amp; Chapter 14 for links to resources. Before registering for each semester, you are required to meet with your advisor (Gavin) to review your tracking sheet (SMAST academic milestone document) and discuss plans for the forthcoming semester (classes, activities, etc.). Course of study: Work with Gavin when crafting and revisiting your individual mentoring plans to identify classes that you will take during your academic program. Look beyond those offered at SMAST to include elsewhere at UMassD, the UMass system, and also at other institutions (consider the value of a semester exchange). A list of classes that lab members have taken, and suggested course of study schedule for Fay lab grad students can be found in Chapter 11. We schedule regular individual meetings with Gavin throughout the year. At a minimum during the semester these will take place every two weeks, although there may be times when more regular meetings are needed. Meetings are a chance for you to get focused time with Gavin to discuss and work on your research. Thus they are your time, not Gavin’s. Come with an agenda with a list of things that you want to accomplish and work on during that time. We share our research at local, national, and international meetings, and publish our findings in the scientific literature. Gavin strives to provide financial support for grad students to attend at least one major conference per year. You should expect to give a presentation (a poster or a talk) on your work at these. 6.6.1 Funding Gavin does not typically accept students into the lab without being able to guarantee at least 2 years of full funding. Students are encouraged to seek and apply for extramural funding to support their work. This includes scholarships and fellowships to pay for salary, but also smaller grants for travel, workshop attendance, or research costs. There are many opportunities out there, particularly for students. Some resources are outlined in Chapter @{funding}. 6.7 Undergraduate students You will most likely be working with one of the lab’s research team as your primary research supervisor. The grad student or postdoc you are working with on your project will be your primary source of contact and you should work with them to establish and define your work schedule, protocols for your work, and to ensure you have the necessary equipment to perform your work tasks. Although the grad student / postdoc is your primary contact, always feel like you can reach out to both Gavin as lab PI and Ashleigh as lab manager. We are excited to help you use your position in the lab to further your career goals and want to work with you to help you achieve them. If you are an hourly worker (either federal work study or grant supported) then it is critical that you complete your timesheets through HR Direct with your hours worked, so that you can get paid. Please submit your electronic timesheet each week by noon on Friday, to allow time for Gavin to approve. Alert your research supervisor AND Gavin as soon as possible if there are any complications with regard to pay. We want you to be compensated for your work in a timely fashion. 6.8 Postdoctoral researchers Postdocs are independent researchers and likely will have significant collaboration with researchers at other institutions as part of their research and position. Postdocs in the lab may also be sharing time between SMAST and another opportunity. In general, postdocs are expected to: * Be present and involved in lab meetings, workshops, campus seminars, and conferences. * Provide mentorship, technical support, and assistance to other lab members * Communicate both successes and sticking points on a regular basis with the PI * Work independently and collaboratively * Participate in professional development opportunities * Lead and assist in designated research projects * Develop and submit proposals to fund future research On day 1 of his postdoc at NOAA NEFSC, Gavin’s postdoc advisor said “Your first job is to look for your next job”. While a postdoctoral position is a scienctific research position, it is also a training opportunity and a step to something else, and a full-time permanent position beats a postdoc. Do not feel bad or awkward about pursuing (and taking) employment opportuntities, and also training opportunities that help you move toward that next step. We want you to succeed! [As benefited employees at UMass Dartmouth, postdocs are able to enroll in a limited amount of graduate coursework as part of their benefits package. Talk with Gavin about this.] Postdocs will likely have active roles on advisory working groups or other professional service roles. If opportunities are not immediately apparent through your funded research, then Gavin can help strategize about where is a useful space to target your involvement. 6.9 Research staff Much like post-docs, research staff operate as independent and collaborative researchers on assigned projects. Given these are often working directly alongside Gavin, meetings will likely be more frequent than those with others in the lab. Weekly meetings should have clear agendas, and can often be used as collaborative working time to make progress on specific tasks. In general, staff are expected to: Be present and involved in lab meetings, workshops, campus seminars, and conferences Provide technical support and assistance to other lab members Communicate both successes and sticking points on a regular basis with PI Work independently and collaboratively Lead and assist in designated research projects Participate in professional development opportunities (i.e., workshops, conferences, submitting previous position manuscripts [without detracting from new position]) Seek and pursue new funding opportunities when appropriate (this will likely be dependent on your timeline) Produce expected output from assigned grants Be flexible! Additional projects may be assigned to give additional funding. Serve as a role model and go-to resource for other members of the lab Research staff positions may be somewhat flexible in scope. For example, the position may include lab management responsibilities and leadership. If so, the expectations may extend further into scheduling meetings, reserving rooms and maintaing the lab manual, GitHub account, and Gmail/Google Drive account, etc. "],

This can be used select what items you want to bring into specific CVs. - Label some sections as “Selected” (i.e., “Selected Presentations” or “Selected Publications”), and only chose the items you wish to showcase. These can be most recent, or focus on showing a diversity of publications/presentations/etc. - Have separate sections for “Published” versus “In Prep/Review” work. - Put your thesis/dissertation title in the Education section (instead of in your published work). - Consider adding a “Research Interests” section, which is essentially a keywords list. This can be tailored to specific applications as well. - What to always include: - Degrees - Positions held - Publications - Presentations - Awards, Honors, Grants - Professional activities DO NOTs: - Avoid overloading your CV with excessive detail. - Avoid fancy formatting. - Avoid mixing published work with in prep/review/theses/dissertations. - Avoid including personal information (i.e., SSNs, marital status, etc), but also make sure you are including apprpriate contact information. - In longer CVs, do not bury the essential items (listed above). Keep them clear, succinct, and at the beginning. 9.2 Personal Websites Information has been adapted from Gavin’s Web Presence Lecture from his Science Communication course (MAR 580) Why have a curated website? People will Google you. They might as well see what you want them to. Give people an easy way to find you and your work. What should you include? not an exhaustive list BioSketch Research interests/overview Projects Publications CV Blog posts Contact info 9.3 Social Media Platforms: - Twitter - Instagram - Facebook - LinkedIn - Researchgate All have a different purpose and type of engagement. Most important tip: Think deliberately about how you want to use these tools. It is important to remember you are essentially building a ‘brand’ for yourself using these platforms. For example, it may be useful to have a science twitter (in addition to a personal one if you have one) where you exclusively follow and engage with scientists, journals, organizations, etc to directly interact with science that your interested in.

["courses.html", "Chapter 11 Courses 11.1 Suggested course schedule", " Chapter 11 Courses There are many courses available to you within both UMass Dartmouth and the wider UMass system (as well as other options too!). Deciding on course of study should be done as part of your planning with Gavin, &amp; perhaps also through discussions with your committee. Remember, this is your program &amp; you should get out of it what you want, and that includes choosing courses. That said, there are some courses that most students in the lab will take (in part due to program requirements), so here we lay out some suggestions and provide resources for courses offered at both SMAST and elsewhere on campus that lab members have found useful. Course of study should be selected with the program requirements in mind - as always, refer to the Intercampus Marine Science Program Manual. 11.1 Suggested course schedule Students generally take a full time credit load of 9 credits per semester while they are fulfiling the credit requirements for the degree. An exception is in the first year of study when students take 10 credits to meet the graduate seminar credit program requirement. In the Fay lab, we tend to take more (ALL?) of the quantitative courses on offer. Several SMAST courses are offered on an alternating basis every 2 years. Particularly for MS students, you may want to take advantage of courses when they are offered, even if this means taking them out of the natural ‘sequence’. 11.1.1 Year 1 Most students take many of their core program requirements in the first year.

Most of our team uses the open source software R for a lot of their workflow, though you probably want to also learn an additional tool during your time in the lab (for many, the natural choice here is TMB and/or ADMB, as these C++ template languages are the basis for many statistical population dynamics models in fisheries stock assessment). Fortunuately, there are heaps of resources (including your labmates!) to help you with your learning. 12.1 Introductory R learning resources Welcome to R! There are so many learning resources out there it can feel a little overwhelming in terms of what to choose! Right now, we REALLY like this short intro course by @juliesquid &amp; @allisonhorst.
