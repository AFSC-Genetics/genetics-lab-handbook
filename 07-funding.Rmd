# Funding {#funding}

Gavin does not typically accept students into the lab without being able to guarantee at least 2 years of full funding. 

However, Gavin encourages all students to apply for external funding through graduate scholarships. Some relevant ones include the Sea Grant Graduate Fellowships, NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program, and NOAA Nancy Foster scholarships, though there are many other opportunities (more provided in the link below).

Here is Gavin's current funding [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YGtSWJj2socIGtHLbBpHmJ7rPeDiECsdjgIz8FxUYMA/edit?ts=5e289f99#gid=0). Gavin not only encourages students to obtain additional funding, but also staff and post-docs. And for all to apply for travel grants when attending conferences, where applicable. 

This resource is updated fairly regularly, and largely contains resources to fund yourself/research. It includes the opportunity name, institituion, link, grad/undergrad/postdoc/all/early career/etc designation, the deadline, and important notes. 

Gavin will also share funding opportunites as they come up, either to the group or in individual meetings.
