# Outreach {#outreach}
 
![](img/outreach.jpg)

Participating in outreach is a wonderful way to engage with the public and share the important work we do at the lab. Outreach is encouraged for all MML staff. This includes anything from a formal NOAA event to simply visiting a classroom to teach kids about marine mammals. On this page you'll find information about outreach events, instruction on how to reserve materials, and other ideas you can add to!

## Outreach Ideas 

There are a number of local outreach opportunties such as:

- Polar Science Days at the [Pacific Science Center](https://pacificsciencecenter.org/)
- Marine Mammal Mania at the [Seattle Aquarium](https://www.seattleaquarium.org/)
- [NOAA Live! Alaska](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/outreach-and-education/noaa-live-alaska)

Outreach in local schools are often established opportunistically through personal contacts. Staff can also take the step of reaching out to schools with less resources to provide outreach opportunities to students. Staff have also participated as judges in school science fairs, talked with kids at Little Anchor, the onsite childcare and preschool, and participated in the WRC Summer Science Camp. 

## Outreach Materials

There are outreach materials available through both the MML as well as the AFSC Communications division. There you can find banners and more general materials as well as fisheries specific supplies. The MML collection includes a more extensive selection of marine mammal skulls, pelts, baleen, and plenty of whale lice, which is always a big hit! 

You can get a sneak peak of what's in the MML collection by perusing the [Inventory](https://docs.google.com/document/d/0B_omi4vXP064Rl9xTGV2a0xyYmowTnlPR1U4MWFSTXpYaFRv/edit?resourcekey=0-sEV7CbC4j-PaLg1kiyOKbA). These materials are stored in the shared storage room 4-1045 under the counter across from PEP's storage locker.  Feel free to sort through these bins to put together what you would like to take to your outreach event. 

### Reserving MML Outreach Materials
To reserve the MML outreach materials, check the [MML Outreach Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=bm9hYS5nb3ZfdnY5cWFuZGppa2ozaDNnZWQ3MjFrbWdubmtAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ) to ensure there's not a conflict with another reservation, and then create an event to cover the days you'll need the materials. Inlcude the following in your event details: 

- your name
- name of the event you plan to attend
- date, time, location of the event itself
- include the days needed to pick up and drop off supplies in the date range of your reservation

When your event is completed, please return materials promptly and [record your outreach event](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/communications/outreach-and-education/outreach-participation) to help the communications division track staff participation in outreach events across the center. 

- Include descriptions of some PEP outreach projects and the acoustic slideshow

Creative MMLites have developed and built upon a number of powerpoint presentations over the years. Feel free to make use of and contribute to these for your event [MML Outreach presentation materials](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dRKkJzLLPw__Rq30W6CWsGiWX2OaXLEj).

Visit the [AFSC Education & Outreach page](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/communications/outreach-and-education)to see what else is available through the Communications division. 

Feel free to contact [Erin Moreland](erin.moreland@noaa.gov) or [Michelle Lander](michelle.lander@noaa.gov) for assistence. 

## Record your outreach event 
[*Record your outreach event here!*](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/communications/outreach-and-education/outreach-participation)
Recording your event allows the AFSC Communications division to track the types of activities staff are participating in, the materials needed/used, and summarize the number of people impacted by our combined efforts. 

Thank you!
