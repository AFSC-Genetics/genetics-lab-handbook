# Outreach {#outreach}
 
![](img/outreach.jpg)

Participating in outreach is a wonderful way to engage with the public and share the important work we do at the lab. Outreach is encouraged for all ABL Genetics staff. This includes anything from a formal NOAA event to simply visiting a classroom to teach kids about genetics. On this page you'll find information about outreach events, instruction on how to reserve materials, and existing ideas you can add to!

## Outreach Ideas 

There are a number of local outreach opportunties such as:

- [NOAA Live! Alaska](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/outreach-and-education/noaa-live-alaska)
- [Discovery Southeast](https://www.discoverysoutheast.org/)
- [Juneau STEAM Coalition](https://juneausteam.org/)
- [Alaska Sea Week](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/student-opportunity/alaska-sea-week)
- [Sealaska Heritage](https://www.sealaskaheritage.org/)

The AFSC Communications and Education Coordinator, [Stori Oates](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/contact/stori-oates) will also regularly send out emails with opportunities to help with other outreach activities, such as helping out on a TSMRI tour, speaking on a career panel, or judging a local science fair. She is also always happy to talk about any new outreach ideas or materials you may have, and can put you in contact with local educators. 

## Outreach Materials

Stori Oates has outreach materials and activity kits available for use at local STEAM nights and other events. There are also some resources through the [AFSC Communications division](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/communications). There you can find banners and more general materials as well as fisheries specific supplies. 

### Reserving Outreach Materials

Email [Stori Oates](mailto:stori.oates@noaa.gov) if you would like to borrow any of her outreach materials.

Visit the [AFSC Education & Outreach page](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/communications/outreach-and-education) to see what else is available through the Communications division. 

## Record your Outreach Event 
[*Record your outreach event here!*](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/communications/outreach-and-education/outreach-participation)
This form can be completed before or after your event. Recording your event allows the center to track the types of activities staff are participating in, the materials needed/used, and summarize the number of people impacted by our combined efforts. 

Thank you!

## How to Host an Intern or Volunteer 

Guidance and links for hosting an Intern can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/communications/outreach-and-education/host-an-intern).

Guidance and links for hosting a Student Volunteer and a Non-Student Volunteer/Guest Worker can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/administrative/volunteers).

## Presentations and Publications

One way to reach a broader audience and promote ABL Genetics research is through [presentations and publications](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/science-data/alaska-fisheries-science-center-publications). Support for creating poster presentations is available through [AFSC Graphics](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/communications/graphics)

All formal research documents that present data, results, discuss findings, or offer conclusions in which an author or coauthor cites AFSC affiliation are required to go through the Center's [Research Publication Tracking System (RPTS)](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/communications/publications) review/approval process.
