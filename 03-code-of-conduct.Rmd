# Code of Conduct {#code}

A _Code of Conduct_ is a set of basic ground rules that we ask participants in lab spaces to follow. The goal is to create an open and inclusive space for our work that helps us achieve our collective goals. Along with our lab culture/philosophy,  it also provides a benchmark for self-evaluation and helps better define our identity as a community. 

Our draft lab [code of conduct can be found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vpf2ud8-rTCZQPPDpB-L3yTD4KPKoSyIs34YxjCGO9w/edit?usp=sharing).  
Our draft has been reviewed by the SMAST Dean's Office and we are awaiting review by UMassD Human Resources and office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion.   

We expect all lab members to adhere the policies and guidelines outlined here.  

Additional information and resources can be found in the [SMAST Code of Conduct and Diversity Statement](https://www.umassd.edu/media/umassdartmouth/smast/lab-pdf-files/SMAST---Code-of-conduct-and-diversitystatement_2.25.20-(1).docx).  

Our Code of Conduct is based on the [example policy created by the Geek Feminism community](https://geekfeminism.wikia.org/wiki/Community_anti-harassment).
