The MML Shared Labs are located on the first floor of Building 4. They are monitored by the Shared Labs Manager and one or more points of contact. Staff serving as POCs are responsible for the following:

- Complete Lab Safety Training provided by the AFSC Safety Office every 5 years.
- Conduct monthly safety inspections with their PL (Shared Labs Manager only).
- Resolve or coordinate the resolution of any safety issues identified by the safety inspections within 1 month of identification.
- Respond or coordinate the response to directives about lab spaces (e.g., Washington State Tier II chemical inventory, AFSC chemical inventory) accurately and on time.  
- Resolve or coordinate the resolution of minor issues (e.g., unlabeled items in common areas, messes) identified by the Shared Labs Manager within 3 days of identification.
- Ensure that all chemical products and specimens in chemicals are labeled, stored, and disposed of according to NOAA and AFSC Safety Office guidelines.
- Other lab-related duties as assigned by AFSC Safety Office or MML leadership.
 
Remember to include the Shared Labs Manager on all communications about safety issues and lab directives, as well as minor lab issues.

#### General Lab Policies

1. The Shared Labs are available to all staff and, at present, we do not require advance reservations to use them. However, to avoid potential scheduling conflicts, staff are **highly** encouraged to put their lab plans on the [MML Shared Labs Google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=bm9hYS5nb3ZfZTVybmY2dGdjNXVraWQxZGhkcjNia2xwZWtAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ).
2. Ensure that all specimens, equipment, etc. are stored and labeled according to MML Shared Labs policy (see section below).
3. *Clean up after yourself!* Please make sure program storage areas are organized and common areas are clean and clutter-free. Notify the Shared Labs Manager of any issues that require attention. 
4. No nitrile gloves outside of the labs. If you need to leave your workstation to go to your office or talk to someone, dispose of your gloves and get a new pair when you return.
5. Turn on hood fans before working in the labs, especially if you are doing anything that might have a strong smell (e.g., using steam kettles, processing scats). Turn the dial to the maximum time. Control dials are located in the Food Habits and Tooth Labs. 
6. Dispose of lab waste in the proper receptacles (see section below).
7. There is a 5-gallon carboy of 95% ethanol in the Dissection Lab that is available for all MML programs to share. If you notice the carboy is low/empty, ask the Shared Labs Manager to refill it.
8. Working alone in the Shared Labs is not recommended. Notify your coworkers prior to working in the lab and ensure that at a minimum of 1 person is nearby and aware that the work is occurring. **Never enter or work in a walk-in freezer alone.**
