DRAFT (eem)

Participating in outreach is encouraged for all MML staff. This includes anything from a formal NOAA event to simply visiting a classroom to teach kids about marine mammals. On this page you'll find information about existing outreach materials as well, instruction on how to reserve materials, and other ideas you can add to!

## Outreach Ideas 

There are a number of local outreach opportunties including:

- Polar Science Days at the [Pacific Science Center](https://pacificsciencecenter.org/)
- Marine Mammal Mania at the [Seattle Aquarium](https://www.seattleaquarium.org/)
- [NOAA Live! Alaska](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/outreach-and-education/noaa-live-alaska)

etc, etc, etc - look for more regular events you've forgotten about... 

school events - science fair judge, classroom volunteer, etc
