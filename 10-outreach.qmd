Add pictures from outreach events

DRAFT (eem)

Participating in outreach is encouraged for all MML staff. This includes anything from a formal NOAA event to simply visiting a classroom to teach kids about marine mammals. On this page you'll find information about existing outreach materials as well, instruction on how to reserve materials, and other ideas you can add to!

## Outreach Ideas 

There are a number of local outreach opportunties including:

- Polar Science Days at the [Pacific Science Center](https://pacificsciencecenter.org/)
- Marine Mammal Mania at the [Seattle Aquarium](https://www.seattleaquarium.org/)
- [NOAA Live! Alaska](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/outreach-and-education/noaa-live-alaska)

etc, etc, etc - look for more regular events you've forgotten about... 

school events - science fair judge, classroom volunteer, etc


## Outreach Materials

There are outreach materials available through both the MML as well as the AFSC Communications department. There you can find banners and more general materials as well as fisheries specific supplies. The MML collection is more marine mammal focused and includes a more extensive selection of pelts, skulls, baleen, and plenty of whale lice, which is always a big hit!

You can get a sneak peak of what's in the MML collection by perusing the [Inventory](https://docs.google.com/document/d/0B_omi4vXP064Rl9xTGV2a0xyYmowTnlPR1U4MWFSTXpYaFRv/edit?resourcekey=0-sEV7CbC4j-PaLg1kiyOKbA). These materials are stored in the shared storage room ##? under the counter across from PEP's storage locker.  Feel free to sort through these bins to put together what you would like to take to your outreach event. 

### Reserving MML Outreach Materials
To reserve the MML outreach materials, check the [MML Outreach Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=bm9hYS5nb3ZfdnY5cWFuZGppa2ozaDNnZWQ3MjFrbWdubmtAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ) to ensure there's not a conflict with another reservation, and then create an event to cover the days you'll need the materials. Inlcude the following in your event details: 

- your name
- name of the event you're attending
- date, time, location of the event itself
- reserve the days that you'll need to pickup and drop off supplies

When your event is completed, please return materials promptly and [**RECORD YOUR OUTREACH EVENT HERE**](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/communications/outreach-and-education/outreach-participation) to help the center track staff participation.
