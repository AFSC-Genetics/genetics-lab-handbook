- Though out of date, the __unofficial__ [SMAST graduate student page](http://www.smast.umassd.edu/grad_students/) is a good resource to know exists.


### For New Employees:
- New employee onboarding checklists and paperwork (currently under construction!)
- Key contacts if you are a new hire: 
    - [Leslie Mercure: Recruitment Manager & Sandra Escaleira: Benefits Specialist](https://www.umassd.edu/hr/hr-team/)
- [Parking](https://www.umassd.edu/parking/) and transportation: Parking at SMAST is free and if you are a new hire (staff) then parking on Main Campus is also free. Go to the lower level of the campus center on Main Campus to get a parking decal. But there is short/temporary parking available on campus so you may feel it's not necessary to obtain a pass. It's up to you and your preferences!
