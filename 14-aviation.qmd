*MML Training Database

The lab keeps track of fieldwork training completed by all personnel in a [MML Training Database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gZfKhD85VjolvN2jiEc1u4dXaJbkZZTVuVN5v-qZZbk/edit#gid=1613635922). The database is organized by Program and maintained by the MML Operations team. To update your information, email a copy of your training certificate to Jim Freed (james.freed@noaa.gov).
