# Aviation Safety Equipment & Training

![](img/N56RF.jpg)

This section provides a centralized place for personnel to find information about aviation safety equipment that is shared among MML Programs. It includes information about aviation safety equipment inventory, usage, and maintenance, as well as, training requirements needed for field assignments that involve the use of aircraft.

## Training

NOAA's Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO) governs the [Aviation Safety Program](https://www.omao.noaa.gov/learn/aircraft-operations/about/aviation-safety-program) which provides policy and guidance to support the safe operation and use of aircraft.

An overview of all safety-related training that is required or recommended for MML staff and affiliates is detailed in the [MML Safety Training Memo](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eLWtvgADLWyD467AjoP9x-Z97PQPeoZU). Training specific to aerial surveys is outlined in bullet 4 of the memo and included below.

Aerial Surveys – all participants in NOAA aerial surveys must complete the following list of trainings:

1. Aviation Egress (Water Ditching, Safety & Survival) – required every 5 years for aerial surveys, MML recommends every 3 years (2-day class).
  + Helicopter Emergency Egress Device (HEED) training – required every 5 years, in coordination with above training (4-hour class) if planning to carry a HEED device.
2. Aviation Safety & Cold Weather Survival – required 1 time for aerial surveys by NOAA, MML requires every 5 years, recommends every 3 years (this course has always been combined and topics covered with the 2-day required Aviation Egress training course for MML).
3. Egress Videos – required to watch annually by NOAA’s Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) [Link to FAA videos](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/avs/offices/aam/med_pilots/aircrew_
videos/) (2.5 hours of videos).
4. Online CLC Courses - required annually for aerial surveys, recommended for contracted transport flights to remote field sites (https://doc.csod.com/catalog/CustomPage.aspx?id=20000416):
  + NOAA Aviation Policy & Procedures – required for NOAA participants.
  + Basic Aviation Safety & Survival – required for both NOAA and non-NOAA participants.
  + Aviation Health – required for both NOAA and non-NOAA participants.

*MML Training Database*

The lab keeps track of fieldwork training completed by all personnel in a [MML Training Database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gZfKhD85VjolvN2jiEc1u4dXaJbkZZTVuVN5v-qZZbk/edit#gid=1613635922). The database is organized by Program and maintained by the MML Operations team. To update your information, email a copy of your training certificate to Jim Freed (james.freed@noaa.gov).
