## Training

NOAA's Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO) governs the [Aviation Safety Program](https://www.omao.noaa.gov/learn/aircraft-operations/about/aviation-safety-program) which provides policy and guidance to support the safe operation and use of aircraft.

An overview of all safety-related training that is required or recommended for MML staff and affiliates is detailed in the [MML Safety Training Memo](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eLWtvgADLWyD467AjoP9x-Z97PQPeoZU). Training specific to aerial surveys is outlined in bullet 4 of the memo and included below.

All participants in NOAA aerial surveys must complete the following:

| Helicopter Emergency Egress Device (HEED)|   every 5 years    |                       | -can be combined with Aviation Egress<br><br>-only need if carrying a HEED device |
| Aviation Safety & Cold Weather Survival  |   every 5 years    |     every 3 years     | topics are covered in and combined with Aviation Egress |
| [Egress Videos](https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/avs/offices/aam/med_pilots/aircrew_videos/) |   annually         | 2.5 hours of material |

*MML Training Database*

The lab keeps track of fieldwork training completed by all personnel in a [MML Training Database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gZfKhD85VjolvN2jiEc1u4dXaJbkZZTVuVN5v-qZZbk/edit#gid=1613635922). The database is organized by Program and maintained by the MML Operations team. To update your information, email a copy of your training certificate to Jim Freed (james.freed@noaa.gov).
