# Field Safety

The Genetics Lab does not lead any field research as of now but lab members do participate in field work. A field saftety briefing should be provided by the project lead for which the lab member is participating. 

## Training

ABL keeps track of field work training completed by all personnel. Common trainings required for participation in vessel surveys includes Cold Water Survival and First Aid/CPR. Cold Water Survival training is required every 3 years. First aid/CPR is required every 2 years. PFD and immersion suits should be provided by the program that is leading the field work. Check with the field research project lead to see if other saftey trainings or equipment are required for field work particiaption.
