# Welcome!

Welcome to our book of magical secrets.  


<br>

The content for this book was developed as part of our group's participation in the [Openscapes Champions program](https://openscapes.org).  
We are extremely grateful to and acknowledge [Dr. Julia Stewart Lowndes](https://twitter.com/juliesquid)' role in helping shape how our lab both works and how we articulate our identity.
