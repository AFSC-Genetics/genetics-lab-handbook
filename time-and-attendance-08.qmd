## Premium Pay

Common types of Premium Pay include Overtime over 40, Hazard Pay Differential, Comp Time/Travel Earned, and Holiday Worked. These are most often associated with fieldwork, but not always.

Approval for premium pay requires 2 steps:

1. Request in webTA - submitted online and approved by your supervisor.
2. CD-81 form - submitted to your supervisor and Mary Foote. 

If you go over your approved premium pay amount(s), you must submit a new request in webTA AND a new CD-81 to cover the additional hours.
