# Lab Safety

AFSC's Safety and Environmental Compliance Office (SECO) maintains the [Safety](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/safety/) page on the intranet. Here, you'll find information and services related to:

- Reporting an accident, injury, or illness
- The AFSC Chemical Hygiene Plan
- Safety Data Sheets (SDS)
- Safety training

Additional information and documents are available in the [AFSC Safety folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0Bxd9wnakNHDidG92djFoSDFJdTQ?resourcekey=0-CCGigU8eW59YQ9RN9_8Wpg) on Google Drive. 

## ABL Genetics Shared Labs

![](/img/shared-labs-schematic.JPG)

The Auke Bay Laboratories (ABL) Genetics Labs are located on the second floor of the Ted Stevens Marine Research Institute lab wing in Rooms 211, 212, and 213. They are monitored for safety by the Shared Labs Manager and one or more points of contact. Staff serving as POCs are responsible for the following:

- Complete Lab Safety Training provided by the AFSC Safety Office every 5 years.
- Conduct monthly safety inspections with their PL (Shared Labs Manager only).
- Resolve or coordinate the resolution of any safety issues identified by the safety inspections within 1 month of identification.
- Respond or coordinate the response to directives about lab spaces (e.g., Washington State Tier II chemical inventory, AFSC chemical inventory) accurately and on time.  
- Resolve or coordinate the resolution of minor issues (e.g., unlabeled items in common areas, messes) identified by the Shared Labs Manager within 3 days of identification.
- Ensure that all chemical products and specimens in chemicals are labeled, stored, and disposed of according to NOAA and AFSC Safety Office guidelines.
- Other lab-related duties as assigned by AFSC Safety Office or ABL Genetics leadership.
 
Remember to include the Shared Labs Manager on all communications about safety issues and lab directives, as well as minor lab issues.

### Requirements for Staff Working in Labs

Staff working in the ABL Genetics Labs must demonstrate that they have completed the following:
•	AFSC Lab Safety training (unable to open)
•	AFSC Hazardous Communications training (unable to open)
•	Read and understand the AFSC Chemical Hygiene Plan
•	Lab orientation with Genetics Program technician
•	Ability to find AFSC MSDS/SDS online 
•	Read and understand relevant SOP(s)
•	Training on specialized equipment

Staff wishing to use the Shared Labs intermittently for non-lab tasks (e.g., gear cleaning) must demonstrate that they have completed the following:

- AFSC [Hazardous Communications training](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9FENDWeC8QRoMHcI979rhOoYul8XKOx0-2FWyGegL8plnuQ/viewform/)
- Lab orientation with Shared Labs Manager or Supervisor
- Ability to find AFSC [MSDS/SDS online](https://app.riskandsafety.com/)

<br />

### Storage and Labels

All hazardous materials in the labs must be labeled according to AFSC and OSHA guidelines. At minimum, this includes the chemical name and primary hazard (pictogram sticker). **Unknown, unlabeled chemicals are a dangerous and expensive hazard.** They cannot be disposed of until they are identified and tests cost approximately $800 per sample. Pictogram stickers are available from the Shared Labs Manager or AFSC SECO. 

Non-hazardous items should also be clearly labeled with a contact name or program and a description of the item (e.g., SSL scats). For walk-in freezer items, paper tags, Sharpies, and color-coded flagging tape are available in the Freezer Room. Color-coded masking tape (for cabinet doors) is available from the Shared Labs Manager.

Hazardous materials must be stored in appropriate containers and locations. For example:

- Only store compatible materials together (e.g., flammables with flammables).
- No liquid hazards may be stored above eye level.
- Corrosives must be stored in a secondary container.

Other items should be stored in your program’s designated area(s) of the labs or freezers. Storage is defined as *anything that will not be in use within the next week*. Items left in common areas will be reported to lab POCs.

<br />

### Chemical Inventories and Reporting

ABL must maintain a detailed inventory of all chemicals used and stored in the Genetics Labs. The inventory is for chemical products only, not specimens stored in chemicals. 
Individual users are responsible for reviewing the AFSC chemical inventory and updating this information in the AFSC Chemical Inventory. This must be done at least annually

**Formalin Reporting**

We are also required to report all new purchases of formalin or formaldehyde to AFSC SECO. Please notify the Shared Labs Manager if you buy these chemicals. 

<br />

### Freezers

-20°C and -80°C freezers are located in Rooms 207, 211, 212, and 213.

Emergency contacts for freezer issues are posted on the door to each lab.

Reminders:
•	Freezers are for biological specimens only - absolutely no food or beverages are allowed. 
•	Do not store samples in another program’s freezer without their express permission.
•	Never put dry ice in the walk-in freezers - this is a suffocation hazard.
•	Be sure that freezer doors are firmly closed when you’re done.
•	Protect your hands when working with samples in/from the ultra-low freezers.

Reminders:

- Do not store samples in another program's freezer without their express permission.
- Never put dry ice in the walk-in freezers - this is a suffocation hazard.
- Be sure that freezer doors are firmly closed when you're done.
- Protect your hands when working with samples in/from the ultra-low freezers.
- If you are shipping frozen samples, there are extra cold packs in the Bldg 4 walk-in and some insulated boxes under the counter. 

<br />

### Cleaning and Waste Disposal

Please clean up after yourself in the labs. There are loads of cleaning supplies and tools available to you. 

•	Scrub or wipe down surfaces.
•	Put away supplies, tools, and equipment.
•	Make sure anything you leave in a common space is well-labeled.
•	Dispose of hazardous and non-hazardous waste in appropriate receptacle.
•	Dispose of scalpel blades in appropriate receptacle.

When a hazardous waste receptacle is full, fill out the AFSC Waste Pickup Form. Please note that there is a Center-wide monthly limit on formalin/formaldehyde disposal. If you need to dispose of large amounts of these chemicals, please coordinate with SECO before you begin.
