# Welcome!

Welcome to the MML Manual. This repo is intended for current staff of the Marine Mammal Laboratory at the Alaska Fisheries Science Center.

This site serves as a central hub for information on how we do our work and our expectations for our team. It is also a space to document institutional knowledge and important information about procedures and available resources. If you have suggestions for additions or changes, please contact Nancy Friday (nancy.friday\@noaa.gov) or make a pull request.

The content for this site was developed as part of our group's participation in the [Openscapes Champions program](https://openscapes.org). The structure was based on the excellent [Faylab Lab Manual](https://thefaylab.github.io/lab-manual/).
