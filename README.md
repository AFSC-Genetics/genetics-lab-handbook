This Quarto book is intended to be used for current staff of the Genetics Program at the Alaska Fisheries Science Center. If we missed anything, please let Patrick Barry (patrick.barry@noaa.gov) know. You can also do a pull request and we will review the changes. 

We hope this has all the answers you need!
