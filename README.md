# Welcome to the MML Manual! 

This Quarto book is intended to be used for **current** staff of the Marine Mammal Laboratory at the Alaska Fisheries Science Center. If we missed anything, please let Nancy Friday (nancy.friday@noaa.gov) know. You can also do a pull request and we will review the changes. 

We hope this has all the answers you need!
