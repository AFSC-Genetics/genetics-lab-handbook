## Personal Websites

Information has been adapted from Gavin's Web Presence Lecture from his Science Communication course (MAR 580)

**Why have a curated website?**

1. People will Google you. They might as well see what you want them to.
2. Give people an easy way to find you and your work.

**What should you include?**
*not an exhaustive list*

- BioSketch
- Research interests/overview
- Projects
- Publications
- CV
- Blog posts
- Contact info

## Social Media

Platforms

- Twitter
- Instagram
- Facebook
- LinkedIn
- Researchgate

All have a different purpose and type of engagement.

Most important tip: Think deliberately about how you want to use these tools. It is important to remember you are essentially **building a ‘brand’** for yourself using these platforms. For example, it may be useful to have a science twitter (in addition to a personal one if you have one) where you exclusively follow and engage with scientists, journals, organizations, etc to directly interact with science that your interested in.
