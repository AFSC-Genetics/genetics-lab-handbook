*This is not an exhaustive list but should be used to guide CV development*

DOs:
- Think about target audience (and what job/fellowship/grant you are using the CV for).
- Keep a modular approach so it is easy to swap the order and move items around.
- Simple formatting is better, such as using headers, bolding and underlining text, and bullet points.
- Develop a master CV to use as a catch all for everything you have done. This can be used select what items you want to bring into specific CVs.
- Label some sections as "Selected" (i.e., "Selected Presentations" or "Selected Publications"), and only chose the items you wish to showcase. These can be most recent, or focus on showing a diversity of publications/presentations/etc.
- Have **separate** sections for "Published" versus "In Prep/Review" work.
- Put your thesis/dissertation title in the Education section (instead of in your published work).
- Consider adding a "Research Interests" section, which is essentially a keywords list. This can be tailored to specific applications as well.
- What to **always** include:
    - Degrees
    - Positions held
    - Publications
    - Presentations
    - Awards, Honors, Grants
    - Professional activities

DO NOTs:
- Avoid overloading your CV with excessive detail.
- Avoid fancy formatting.
- Avoid mixing published work with in prep/review/theses/dissertations.
- Avoid including personal information (i.e., SSNs, marital status, etc), but also make sure you are including apprpriate contact information.
- In longer CVs, do not bury the essential items (listed above). Keep them clear, succinct, and at the beginning.

**Why have a curated website?**

1. People will Google you. They might as well see what you want them to.
2. Give people an easy way to find you and your work.
