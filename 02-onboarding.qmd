### Office and Laboratory Space

AFSC policy states:

_As stewards of the NOAA Fisheries science mission in Alaska, the AFSC has a mandate to ensure our use of all available resources including physical office, laboratory, and warehouse space, supports the mission. Divisions have differing needs for space and the Science Director's Office has delegated space allocation to the Divisions.
