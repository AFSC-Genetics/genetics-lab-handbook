### Office and Laboratory Space

AFSC policy states:

_As stewards of the NOAA Fisheries science mission in Alaska, the AFSC has a mandate to ensure our use of all available resources including physical office, laboratory, and warehouse space, supports the mission. Divisions have differing needs for space and the Science Director's Office has delegated space allocation to the Divisions. If you have questions regarding how decisions regarding space are made in your Division, please pose these to your Divisional leadership._

Office assignments are based on..._do we want to provide a general guideline here?_

For information on Laboratory Space use see Chapter 6 _need to look up how to link to another chapter in the manual_

### Conference Rooms and Hybrid Meetings

Shared resources such as [conference rooms]( https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/reservations/conference-rooms) are to be shared for maximum space utilization and mission support. While the names of conference rooms may be associated with a specific Division (e.g. the MML conference Room), these are available for all users. 

With meetings now occurring onsite and virtually, the AFSC has provided [Guidance on Holding Inclusive Meetings in a Hybrid Work Environment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K8mBHH6JOdKC4aT0L4jHmTJot9n4fnW9_L9kwdclCkQ/edit). Links to setting up conference rooms with access to Google Meet, Cisco WebEx, and toll free conference call lines can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/reservations/afsc-conference-rooms-built-around-google-meet-kits).

### Key Card and Office Access

NMFS requires the use of the [Common Access Card (CAC)](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/technology/it-security/common-access-card-cac) for login to Windows and Macintosh computers and to access buildings on the WRC campus. Cards must be [renewed every three years](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/administrative/security/cac-renewal).
