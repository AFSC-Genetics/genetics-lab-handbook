# Onboarding {#onboarding}

![](img/onboarding.jpg)

Welcome to AFSC-Genetics, a division of the [Alaska Fisheries Science Center](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/contact/genetics-program-alaska-fisheries-science-center). Whether an FTE, Affiliate, Contractor, Intern/PostDoc or Volunteer, links to general operations can be found here.  

## AFSC Onboarding Checklist

This [Onboarding Checklist](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Gxg-tw76NeptYFkya7M6JSyxsy31mmAu/view) provides prompts to guide supervisors and staff through the first day, Week 1, and Week 2 for Federal and Non-Federal employees. This [ABL New Employee Checklist](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VaIHTh5crAILlIz2Q1B0tq-93dzWt1LA/view?usp=sharing) includes similar information, but is more specific to ABL, and also includes a list of both required and recommended trainings for Federal employees.

There will also be onboarding paperwork required through USA Staffing if you are a Federal employee. You should receive an email prior to your start date with this information. 

Our Divisional contact for onboarding new employees is:  . 

## Facilities

AFSC-Genetics is located at Auke Bay Laboratories (ABL)/Ted Stevens Marine Research Institute (TSMRI) in Juneau, AK. 

### Keys, Key fobs, and Common Access Cards

ABL requires the use of the [Common Access Card (CAC)](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/technology/it-security/common-access-card-cac) to access buildings and laboratories and for login to Windows and Macintosh computers. Cards require renewal based on your position. FTE CAC are [renewed every three years](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/administrative/security/cac-renewal) while contractors 
and postdoc renewal will be based on projected
durations of contracts.  

If you are based in Juneau, you will get your CAC in the Federal Building downtown in the Coast Guard administrative office, Room 711 at 709 West 9th St. You can schedule an appointment to get your CAC [here](https://idco.dmdc.osd.mil/idco/locator). They also have walk-in hours between 9-10 am M-F.

Rebekah Jones (rebekah.jones@noaa.gov) manages the keys and key fob acess to AFSC lab spaces. Physical keys are used for office spaces and the eDNA lab. All other lab spaces are accessed using a fob. 

### Office and Laboratory Space

AFSC policy states:

_As stewards of the NOAA Fisheries science mission in Alaska, the AFSC has a mandate to ensure our use of all available resources including physical office, laboratory, and warehouse space, supports the mission. Divisions have differing needs for space and the Science Director's Office has delegated space allocation to the Divisions. If you have questions regarding how decisions regarding space are made in your Division, please pose these to your Divisional leadership._

Office assignments are based on criteria that include time in service, highest held degree, performance, and whether an FTE or non-Federal employee. 

AFSC-Genetics's laboratory spaces are shared by all programs and staff. For information on lab space use see the Lab Safety chapter.

### Conference Rooms and Hybrid Meetings

Shared resources such as [conference rooms]( https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/reservations/conference-rooms) are to be shared for maximum space utilization and mission support. 

With meetings now occurring onsite and virtually, the AFSC has provided [Guidance on Holding Inclusive Meetings in a Hybrid Work Environment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K8mBHH6JOdKC4aT0L4jHmTJot9n4fnW9_L9kwdclCkQ/edit). Links to setting up conference rooms with access to Google Meet, Cisco WebEx, and toll free conference call lines can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/reservations/afsc-conference-rooms-built-around-google-meet-kits).

### Parking and Transportation -- include electric car info??

Parking is available onsite in the designated areas. 

NOAA also offers a [non-taxable transit-fare subsidy program](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/cao/about-ocao/logistics-operations-division/noaa-transit-subsidy-program) to encourage federal employees to use public mass transportation while commuting to and from work. Unfortunately, public transportation in Juneau does not go out to Lena Point. Reimbursement to employees who use a non-motorized bicycle for a substantial portion of travel between your residence and the worksite is also availabe.    

## Required Training

New employees will need to complete a number of training modules in the [Commerce Learning Center](https://doc.csod.com/client/doc/default.aspx). Mandatory training schedules and links to NOAA required courses are provided on the main page. Some trainings are only required once while others must be completed annually; check your email for reminders and deadlines. 

Depending on your job duties, you may also be required to complete specialized training, such as Cold Water Survival, Aviation Egress (for field work involving aircraft), or XXX. Check with your supervisor to confirm what trainings are required.

## Time and Attendance

Mark Piotrowski is AFSC-Genetics designated timekeeper. 

One of the first things you will do as a new employee is set up your work schedule (i.e., Traditional, Compressed, or Maxiflex) and telework plan with your supervisor. More information about your options can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/administrative/time-and-attendance).

We use [GovTA](https://docgovta.commerce.gov/govta) to submit biweekly timesheets and request leave. Guidance for timekeeping in GovTA can be found in the GovTA training on the [CLC](https://doc.csod.com/client/doc/default.aspx). If you need further assistance with GovTA, you should contact your timekeeper first and then [CSC-GovTAPMO@doc.gov](mailto:CSC-GovTAPMO@doc.gov) if that does not resolve the issue.

## IT Resources

You can submit an AFSC IT Service Desk request ticket using this [Google form](https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/technology/afsc-it-service-desk). You will need to fill out this form to get IT assistance to initially set up your computer as a new employee, and to install or update software on your computer.

*add info for SEDNA, other VMs, etc...*

## Performance Plans

Each fiscal year (October to October), FTE's will develop a performance plan with their supervisor. Performance plans outline your work duties and priorities for the year, and your ability to achieve or make progress on those tasks impacts things like pay increases and bonuses. You will have the opportunity to check in with your supervisor and adjust your performance plan (as needed) in March or April. 

Plans are created and updated in the [Performance Appraisal and Workforce Solution (PAWS)]( https://sites.google.com/noaa.gov/myafsc/administrative/workforce-management) website. Please check out the [user guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rXX3En7JAa9btXmYjZDvdR1WvsbWugvgWMtdb0K691k/edit#heading=h.b8y4yfr6nrrf) to help guide you on how to enter your accomplishments in PAWS.
