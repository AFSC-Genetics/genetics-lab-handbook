# Offboarding {#offboarding} [update with new image - So long and thanks for all the fish]

![](img/adventure.jpg)

Everybody will at some point leave MML. Having a clear offboarding process ensures there are no loose ends when someone leaves the lab, that others who might carry on work being done can do so most easily, and provides an opportunity to clarify any remaining steps (e.g. publication, data archiving, future collaborations).  



## Offboarding Checklist

Refer to this checklist for separation protocols in areas such as scientific samples, chemicals, project planning database, field gear, manuscripts, paper/electronic reports, and google accounts.

## Email Access 

IT email guidance, in compliance with federal regulations, is to disable email accounts within one business day after clearance (departure/retirement). Once the email account is disabled, it no longer works and anyone who sends a message to it will get a failure notice saying the email account doesn’t exist. Exceptions have been made to extend this deadline if necessary, work with your Program Lead or Lab Director and IT.  

If you wish to let people know you’re leaving, set up an auto-responder message 30 days before your departure date with information such as a new email address. You can also put information in your signature block.  

## Publications and Presentations

Ensure that publications and presentations from your projects are archived in the appropriate folder on the lab Google Drive.  

## Archiving Data [update with new info from Sonja]

Data used in support of your projects should be:

* Saved in appropriate, non-proprietary format with accompanying metadata
* Either in a public archive (e.g., the github repo or another public archive), or if data is proprietary, a 'snapshot' version of the data used in the project should be saved in a private repository accessible to lab members. Alternatively, data could be saved on the lab_fay server drive with appropriate documentation. 
* Linked and briefly described in the project README.  

## Code

Code used or developed for the project should be:

* complete and well-documented, including information in a README about what each file does and workflow to run the code
* Saved on the lab_fay section of the storage server, and also preferably available on github in a public repository.  
 
## Timelines for publications

Science is not finished until it has been communicated. Hopefully, you will publish your results in the peer-reviewed literature so that others can learn and build from your work. During your exit interview, make a plan with Gavin for remaining publications, including a timeline for submission.   

## Turning in equipment

Ensure any lab equipment (e.g. computer and peripherals) you have been using has been returned to the lab, office furniture is present and accounted for, and that tagged equipment has been logged in with the MML Property Manager. Make sure any problems with equipment are documented and that the MML Property Manager and Program Lead have been made aware of them.  

## MML library

Return all books and reprints checked out from the MML library.  

## Removing key card and email access [also include a section on returning government passports]

Key card access to WRC facilities will be terminated [find out if this is the last day onsite]. If an extension is required for email access, discuss process for continuing to access email and google drive with Program Lead and OFIS.
